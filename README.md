# [JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM

## Aim of the project 
Debug the code to prevent users from adding duplicate fitness goals to the list.

# Debugging Duplicate Goals
* Created a variable which fetches the list elements from the goal-List variable.
* Created a loop which is used for iterating through the list elements and getting the content of the elements to compare if they are equal to the input value.
* if they are equal I added an alert to alert the user that the is a duplicate and using the return function to return before adding the new input to the list.

# Challenges
Figuring out which method to tackle this debug, at first I wanted to push the list items to an array and use it to compare to the input value using a loop similar to my solution.

# Feedback
I have no feedback, this project was a good introduction to DOM manipulation and the utilization of basic javascript tools.
